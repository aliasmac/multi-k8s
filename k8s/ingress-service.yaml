# Just for anyone else who runs across this issue, this happened to me.
# The notes say to use apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 but you (or at least me)
# have to use  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1  for deploying on GKE.
# It seems to be because the default version used by GKE is v1.16 and networking.k8s.io/v1
# isn't available until v1.19. Otherwise, I ran into the issue of the ingress-service not
# getting created
